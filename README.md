# Shopify Theme

This theme is made using only Jquery, Tailwind, as well as vanilla JS.
The theme is made for the shopify platform, so it is made also with the liquid templating language. 
It is important to note that this theme is made from scratch and doesn't rely nor inspire from any other existing theme. The design and code are solely made by me.

## Theme features

### 1- Different sections

There are 3 different reusable sections in this project named  Featured Collection, Collection List, and Product Story.
They all have products / collections that are displayed and can be changed in the theme editor

### 2- Hero component

The hero component is a flexible component that can have either a carousel of images with different titles and buttons, or just one main image. It also displays the time remaining to go to the next item.
